## Section 1 - Getting Setup

In this section we'll set up _Azure Cloud Shell_ and _Visual Studio Code_,
so that we're all set to create and deploy ARM templates right from our
desktop.

### Part 1.1 - Setting up Cloud Shell

> Estimated Completion Time: 5 min

Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing
Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience
that best suits the way you work. Cloud Shell offers both PowerShell and Bash
console experience and you can flip between them at the touch of a switch.

_Sidenote: the PowerShell experience is actually PowerShell Core running on top
of Bash in a Linux container!_

**In this lab we'll be using the PowerShell experience using the Az PowerShell
modules, but if you're experienced using Bash and the AzCLI, then feel free
to flick across.**

1. Open Cloud Shell by clicking the Cloud Shell icon:
   ![Open Cloud Shell](images/opencloudshell.png "Open Cloud Shell")

> If you have **not** previously used Azure Cloud Shell:

_When you first create a Cloud Shell a storage account will get created
for you to store your settings, scripts and other files you might create.
This enables you to have access to your own environment no matter what
device you're using.
You can customize the storage account settings if you wish, but in this
lab we'll just be using the defaults._

![Create Cloud Shell Storage](images/cloudshellcreatestorage.png "Create Cloud Shell Storage")

1. Select the **subscription** to create the Storage Account in and click
   **Create storage**.

1. The Storage Account will be created and the Cloud Shell will be started:

   ![Cloud Shell Started](images/cloudshellstarted.png "Cloud Shell Started")

> Once your Azure Cloud Shell storage has been set up or if you had previous set up Azure Cloud Shell:

1. Select **PowerShell** from the shell drop down:

   ![Select PowerShell Cloud Shell](images/cloudshellselectpowershell.png "Select PowerShell Cloud Shell")

### Part 1.2 - Configure Visual Studio Code

> Estimated Completion Time: 5 min

In this part we will configure Visual Studio Code with the following
extensions:

- [Azure Account](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account):
  The Azure Account extension provides a single Azure sign-in and subscription filtering experience for all other Azure extensions. It makes Azure's Cloud Shell service available in VS Code's integrated terminal.
- [Azure Resource Manager Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools):
  This extension provides language support for Azure Resource Manager deployment templates and template language expressions.

We will then be configuring Visual Studio Code to be able to connect
to our Azure Cloud Shell.

1. Start Visual Studio Code.
1. Click Extensions.

   ![Visual Studio Code Extensions](images/vscodeextensions.png "Visual Studio Code Extensions")

1. Search for the `Azure Account` extension and click **Install**.

   ![Visual Studio Code Azure Account Extension](images/vscodeextensionazureaccount.png "Visual Studio Code Azure Account Extension")

1. Search for the `Azure Resource Manager Tools` extension and click `Install`.

   ![Visual Studio Code Azure Resource Manager Tools Extension](images/vscodeextensionazureresourcemanagertools.png "Visual Studio Code Azure Resource Manager Tools Extension")

1. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to bring up the Visual Studio command search.
1. Enter `Cloud Shell` in the command search.
1. Click the **Azure: Open PowerShell in Cloud Shell** command.

   ![Visual Studio Code Cloud Shell Command](images/vscodesearchcloudshellcommand.png "Visual Studio Code Cloud Shell Command")

1. A terminal will open in the Visual Studio Code window requiring you
   to log in to Azure.

   ![Visual Studio Code Cloud Shell Sign In](images/vscodecloudshellsignin.png "Visual Studio Code Cloud Shell Sign In")

1. Click Sign In.
1. A browser window will open where you will be asked to sign into your
   Azure account.
1. Sign into the Azure account you created the Cloud Shell in during
   _Step 1.1_.
1. Return to your Visual Studio Code window where you will now have a
   Cloud Shell console ready to accept commands:

   ![Visual Studio Code Cloud Shell Started](images/vscodecloudshellstarted.png "Visual Studio Code Cloud Shell Started")

This console is exactly the same as the Cloud Shell you get in the
[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or in [shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com).

### Part 1.3 - Register Providers required for Lab

> Estimated Completion Time: 5 min

Depending on your type of subscription (Free, Azure Pass etc.) you may have to register the required resource providers.
This is because by default many resource providers (types of resource providers) are not registered by default.

1. Launch a **Cloud Shell** in Visual Studio Code, in the
   [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or using:

   [![Launch Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/images/launchcloudshell.png "Launch Cloud Shell")](https://shell.azure.com)

1. Depending on your type of subscription (Free, Azure Pass etc.) you may
   have to register the required resource providers. This is because by
   default many resource providers (types of resource providers) are not
   registered by default.

   This only needs to be done once for a subscription. To do this, run
   the following commands in Cloud Shell:

   ```powershell
      Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.Network'
      Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.Compute'
      Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.Storage'
      Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.Web'
      Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.SQL'
   ```

   ![Register Providers](images/registerproviders.png "Register Providers")

Your Azure Account and Visual Studio Code is set up to be able to work
with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates more effectively.

**These tools are very useful throughout Azure and should be part of
any Azure professionals toolbox.**

## Section 2 - Creating an ARM Template

In this section we'll create some resources using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
and then export them as a new ARM Template.

### Part 2.1 - Create Resources in the Portal

Create a simple Azure App Service and App Service plan within a
Resource Group to host a simple web application.

> Estimated Completion Time: 7 min

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Click `Create a Resource`:

   ![Create a Resource](images/portalcreatearesource.png "Create a Resource")

1. Select `Web` under Azure Marketplace and click `Web App`:

   ![Create a Web App](images/portalcreatewebapp.png "Create a Web App")

1. Set an **App name** to one that will be **Globally Unique**. Suggest
   using your initials appended with `gab19-dev`. E.g. `dsrgab19-dev`.
1. Select `Create new` under **Resource Group** and enter the same name
   as the **App Name** but append '-rg'. For example `dsrgab19-dev-rg`.
1. Set **OS** to `Windows`.
1. Set **Publish** to `Code`.

   ![Create a Web App Settings](images/portalcreatewebappsettings.png "Create a Web App Settings")

1. Click `App Service Plan/Location` to configure the App Service Plan.
1. Click `Create New`.

   ![Create a Web App Service Plan](images/portalcreatewebappserviceplan.png "Create a Web App Service Plan")

1. Set **App Service Plan** to the **App Name** prepended with `-sf`. E.g.
   `dsrgab19-dev-sf`.
   This is recommmended as it makes consistency easier when generating the
   template.
1. Set **Location** to `West US 2`.
1. Set **Pricing Tier** to `S1`.

   ![Configure Web App Service Plan](images/portalcreatewebappconfiguresf.png "Configure Web App Service Plan")

1. Click `OK`.
1. Click `Application Insights`.
1. Set **Application Insights** to `Enable`.
1. Select `Create new Resource`.
1. Set **New resource name** to the **App Name** prepended with `-ai`. E.g.
   `dsrgab19-dev-ai`.
   This is recommmended as it makes consistency easier when generating the
   template.
1. Set **Location** to `West US 2`.

   ![Configure App Insights](images/portalcreatewebappconfigureai.png "Configure App Insights")

1. Click `Automation options` to see the exported ARM template that describes
   these resources.
   We are not going to use this template in this lab, but we'll save it anyway
   for reference purposes.
   Instead, we are going to use the template exported at deployment time.

   ![View Create Time Template](images/portalwebappviewcreatetimetemplate.png "View Create Time Template")

1. If you want to store this template for review later, click `Download`.
   We will not be using this template in the Lab.
1. Click the `X` button to close the **Template**.

   ![Close View Create Time Template](images/portalcreatewebappclosetemplateview.png "Close View Create Time Template")

1. Click `Apply`.

   ![Web App Create](images/portalcreatewebappnow.png "Web App Create")

1. Click `Create`.

Your _App Service_  Web App will be deployed.
It will take a few minutes for the service and supporting resources
to be provisioned.
Once it has been provisioned you can check the _App Service_ is up
by opening your _App Service_ and clicking the `URL`.

   ![Test Web App](images/portaltestwebapp.png "Test Web App")

We'll leave this up to you to determine the best way to locate your
_App Service_.

You should see this page when the App Service has started up:

   ![Web App Started Up](images/webappstartedup.png "Web App Started Up")

### Part 2.2 - Export an ARM Template

> Estimated Completion Time: 3 min

The next step is to export the resources we created in _Part 2.1_
as a new ARM Template.
You can either export all resources in a Resource Group or a single
resource at a time.
In this lab we will export the entire _Resource Group_ which will
just export all the resources in the Resource Group.

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Resource Groups` in the Azure Portal.

   ![Select Resource Groups](images/portalopenresourcegroup.png "Select Resource Groups")

1. Click the Resource Group that was created to contain your App Service
   in _Part 2.1_.
1. Click `Export template`.

   ![Export Resource Group](images/portalexporttemplate.png "Export Resource Group")

   It will take a few seconds to generate the ARM Template and other related
   files.

   ![Export Template](images/portalexporttemplatedetails.png "Export Template")

   _We could add this template to our Library by clicking `Add to Library`.
   However, because our template really needs some clean up and
   customization, saving it to the Library isn't something we want to do
   now._

1. Click `Download` to download a zip file containing our template.
1. Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder on your computer
   and make a note of the folder as we will use it in the next step.

   ![Unzip ARM Template Extract](images/unziparmtemplateextract.png "Unzip ARM Template Extract")

The actual ARM Template is the `template.json` file in the zip file.
The other files are scripts that can be used to deploy the ARM Template
as well as an optional parameters file for the template.

### Part 2.3 - Edit an Exported ARM Template

> Estimated Completion Time: 10 min

Once we've exported a template we typically need to do two things:

- Clean up the template by removing any uneccessary properties.
- Add parameters for any properties we want to set when deploying the
  template.

We will do this by editing the `template.json` file in _Visual Studio
Code_.

1. Open _Visual Studio Code_.
1. Select `Open Folder` from the `File` menu.
1. Select the folder you extracted the files to in _Part 2.2_.
1. Select the `template.json` file:

   ![Edit Template in Visual Studio Code](images/visualstudiocdeopentemplate.png "Edit Template in Visual Studio Code")

1.

## Section 5 - Cleanup After the Workshop

### Part 5.1 - Remove Resources and Resource Groups

> Estimated Completion Time: 2 min

This step is optional and only needs to be done if you're finished with
workshop resources and want to get rid of them to save some Azure credit.

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Resource Groups` in the Azure Portal.

   ![Select Resource Groups](images/portalopenresourcegroup.png "Select Resource Groups")

1. Click the Resource Group that was created to contain your App Service
   in _Part 2.1_.
1. Click `Delete resource group`.

   ![Select Resource Groups](images/portalopenresourcegroup.png "Select Resource Groups")

1. Enter the name of the Resource Group to confirm you want to delete
   it and Click Delete.

![Congratulations](images/congratulations.png "Congratulations")
